    <description>Info&#xD;You need to create 1 Linux instance on the public subnet and 1 Window instance on the private subnet to perform this lab.&#xA;To learn how to create EC2 instances and VPCs with public/private subnets, you can refer to the lab:&#xA;About Amazon EC2 Works with Amazon VPC In order to use System Manager to manage our window instances in particular and our instances in general on AWS, we need to give permission to our instances to be able to work with System Manager. In this preparation, we will also proceed to create an IAM Role to grant permissions to instances that can work with System Manager.</description>

      <description>In this step, we will need to create a VPC with 2 public / private subnets. Then create 1 EC2 Instance Linux located in the public subnet, 1 EC2 Instance Windows located in the private subnet.&#xA;The architecture overview after you complete this step will be as follows:&#xA;To learn how to create EC2 instances and VPCs with public/private subnets, you can refer to the lab:</description>

      <description>Create IAM Role In this step, we will proceed to create IAM Role. In this IAM Role, the policy AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore will be assigned, this is the policy that allows the EC2 server to communicate with the Session Manager.&#xA;Go to IAM service administration interface In the left navigation bar, click Roles. Click Create role.</description>
